# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to open files and directories in Kiro directly from the Nautilus file manager through a right-click context menu option. The integration should provide seamless access to Kiro from the file system browser, allowing users to quickly open projects, files, or directories in their preferred IDE.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

2. WHEN a user right-clicks on a directory in Nautilus, THE Nautilus Extension SHALL display an "Open in Kiro" context menu item
3. WHEN a user right-clicks in empty space within a directory in Nautilus, THE Nautilus Extension SHALL display an "Open in Kiro" context menu item to open the current directory
4. WHEN a user selects multiple files or directories, THE Nautilus Extension SHALL display an "Open in Kiro" context menu item that opens all selected items

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the "Open in Kiro" option to successfully launch Kiro with the correct file or directory, so that I can immediately start working on my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Open in Kiro" on a file, THE Nautilus Extension SHALL execute the kiro command with the file path as an argument
2. WHEN a user clicks "Open in Kiro" on a directory, THE Nautilus Extension SHALL execute the kiro command with the directory path as an argument
3. WHEN a user clicks "Open in Kiro" in empty space, THE Nautilus Extension SHALL execute the kiro command with the current directory path as an argument
